# Personal-Accounting Project

Developed mid-2017

## Instructions

Execute "PACX.py" with "transaction.py" and "Boren Personal.txt" in the same directory. Needs python libraries numpy and matplotlib.

### Entering a transaction

Amount: A number

Description: A description

Type: An integer 1 to 5 mapping to different types of transactions

Date: Date

## Purpose

Provide a convenient way to log and store my personal income and expenses for budgeting purposes

## Method

Develop a computer software GUI using Python's tkinter GUI framework

## Achievements

- Input entries into a transaction journal with an amount, description, type (income, expense etc.) and date
- Group and order the transactions by different time periods, eg. weekly or monthly
- Include tools for basic analysis, eg. total income and expenses over a period of time, average spending over a period and visualisation by integrating matplotlib charts.

## Improvements

- Better code structuring and documentation; this was one of my first projects and the vast majority of the code was written on one .py file with 1400 lines, barely no documentation
- Make the usage more intuitive by using better widgets, better labeling and writing documentation
